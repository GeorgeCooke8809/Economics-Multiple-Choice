This is a simple tool using SQLite and Flask in Python with custom HTML, CSS, and JavScript to make a quiz web UI similar to a solo version Kahoot for practicing A-Level Economics multiple choice questions.

# Requirements:
To run, first ensure that Python is installed (tested with version 3.14).
Then install the following libraries:
- Flask,

Do this with the following command:

```pip install Flask```

Different systems will require different variations of the command.
